# RISC-V :  History and Participating Companies





###  2010 	*Prof. Krste Asanovic, Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman*

â€‹			After a short 3-month project at UC Berkeley, guided by *Prof. David Patterson*, published a paper adressing many uses of open-source computer architecture.

> "Instruction Sets Should Be Free: The Case For RISC-V"

His point is

- Free open-source ISA for 
  - greater innovation
  - Shorter TAT and 
  - Low cost. (+ fewer error by increasing participant's distributed and shared verification erfforts)
- Why RISC-V is a better candidate for the open-source ISA
  - And Chisel-based implementation speed-ups the development quite a lot.
  - RISC-V requires about 1/2 area, 1/2 power and faster
