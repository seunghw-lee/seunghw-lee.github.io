# RISC-V :  History and Participating Companies





###  2010 	*Prof. Krste Asanovic, Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman*

â€‹			After a short 3-month project at UC Berkeley, guided by *Prof. David Patterson*, published a paper adressing many uses of open-source computer architecture.

> "Instruction Sets Should Be Free: The Case For RISC-V"

His point is

- Free open-source ISA for 
  - greater innovation
  - Shorter TAT and 
  - Low cost. (+ fewer error by increasing participant's distributed and shared verification erfforts)
- Four key requirements to *a new open-source ISA*
  - *Base-plus-extension ISA* : 
    -  Core inst. for compilers and OSs 
    - + optional extensions for application-specific customization
  - Compact ints. set encoding :  small code size
  - Quadraple- & Single- & Double-precision floating point support
  - 128-bit, 32- and 64-bit addressing :   128-bit for future warehouse scale computing(WSC)
- Why RISC-V is a better candidate for the open-source ISA
  - And Chisel-based implementation speed-ups the development quite a lot.
  - RISC-V requires about 1/2 area, 1/2 power and faster
- Following demand will lead us to a *open-source ISA*
  - Low cost and power for IoTs
  - WSC altanative to 80x86
  - Small, but ubiquitus fractional CPU needs for all SoCs
